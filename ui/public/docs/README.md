# newtorn/cheat

In the past I've had some problems sharing my screen with coworkers using
corporate chatting solutions like Microsoft Teams. I wanted to show them some
of my code, but either the stream lagged several seconds behind or the quality
was so poor that my colleagues couldn't read the code. Or both.

That's why I created Cheat. It allows you to share your screen with good
quality and low latency. Cheat is an addition to existing software and 
only helps to share your screen. Nothing else (:.

## Features

* Multi User Screen Share
* Secure transfer via WebRTC
* Low latency / High resolution
* Simple Install via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/newtorn/cheat) / single binary
* Integrated [TURN](nat-traversal.md) Server see [NAT Traversal](nat-traversal.md)
